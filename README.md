homebrew-fdw
============

This repository contains homebrew formulae for database foreign data wrappers (FDWs).

How do I install these formulae?
--------------------------------

Just `brew tap hashrocket/fdw` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from mxcl/master or another tap, you can
`brew install hashrocket/fdw/<formula>`.
